# Ideas

## Credits
- Flutter
- Photopea
- Brandon (probably)
- Kali Linux contributors, and open source developers everywhere

## Jokes/Easter Eggs
- Persona 5 tarot card
- "Watch video to continue" before taking out loan
- Tony's Cock
- America is the only important country
- Antivirus that's actually a virus (they're also fans of Kali Linux)

### Mario pranks
- Music
- Profile pic
- STAY song at very end

### Nate 4th wall breaks
- First time curating - "for now, pretend that these are important posts and ignore the fact that I wrote all of them."
- TikTok text-to-speech (you'll get used to reading)
- Created [company] because I was salty about my Reddit posts
- "This is probably being recorded somewhere"
- Talk about how I felt when I made Kali
    - "Hope" ending
        I've always needed approval, recognition, and validation. And a couple years ago, I realized that I needed to feel like I was improving the world in order to feel good about myself.
    - "neutral" ending
        When I started making Kali, it was a constant roller coaster of mood swings. I'd feel so much excitement about how cool the ideas were, but then it'd turn into stress [about how I'll never be able to make it "good" enough]. I was so lucky to get the chance to make exactly what I wanted to, but even then it was so difficult for me to feel motivated to work on it day after day. But now that Kali's done, [finish this thought]
    - "greed" ending
        I think I always knew that humanity had a good chance of destroying itself one way or another. If I didn't make an "optimal" AI, someone else would have come along and done it. If someone was going to plunge the world into chaos, it kind of feels nice that I was the one who got to do it.
- Why it's a terrible idea to become a game developer (I guess I could make a mobile game)
- Hate it when a TV show/movie/game makes a big deal about something going viral
- "I guess we could hire a graphic designer. It might look like I'm good at building a UI, but I'm just using default Flutter widgets; most of the difficult stuff was programming in the logic for Kali's behavior"

## Convos
- "spicy" name = hard mode; all 3 of us will bring up the interesting name choice
- social functionality handled on this machine, everything else in the cloud
- Tinder
- Tony's Tinder match:
    - super hot but kinda clingy, wants relationship
    - Tony will get laid then brush her off (if low karma)
- Greedy algorithms
- Gambling with your time rather than money
- Social media is convenient, but has replaced all social interaction (exodus from religion)
    - We know it's a problem, but most of us don't have anything real to replace it with
- Confirmation bias is bullshit
- The Democrat narrative is much more convenient when your life isn't going well
- McDonald's analogy (Mario used to work at drive-thru)
    - almost everyone has been to McDonalds, yet when you work the drive-thru you see pretty much only fat people
    - when you go somewhere, you don't get a good idea of most members; instead you see a lot of people who hang out there a lot
- Our faces = much uglier in real life (barring Tony)
- Didn't have the budget to hire someone to handle budget, so Kali will have to do it
- Why is the screen [color]?:
    - "I'm pretty sure Kali chose that when I first booted [him]. [He] also picked the name '[companyName]' since I didn't feel like doing that."
        - "Always thought [companyName] was an interesting name"
    - "I think Kali chose that a little while ago."
- Mario admits to Kali that he's bi, asks if he should stay Christian
- After buying quantum simulator: Nate asks Kali if [he] knows what [his] purpose is, even though it should be pretty obvious
- Kali is [not a great first choice](https://www.kali.org/docs/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux/) for Linux beginners
